## Image Enhancement
Image enhancement is the process of digitally manipulating a stored image using software. The tools used for image enhancement include many different kinds of software such as filters, image editors and other tools for changing various properties of an entire image or parts of an image. Some of the most basic types of image enhancement tools simply change the contrast or brightness of an image or manipulate the grayscale or the red-green-blue color patterns of an image. Some types of basic filters also allow changing a color image to black and white, or to a sepia-tone image, or adding visual effects.(source - https://www.techopedia.com/definition/26314/image-enhancement)
